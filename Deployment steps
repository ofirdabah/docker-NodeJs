Deployment steps:

open terminal 

type the 3 following command in the terminal in the following order:

sudo docker login(enter username and password)
sudo docker pull ofirdabah/devops_intern
sudo docker run -it -p 8080:3000 --name node-app ofirdabah/devops_intern

enter the link on the terminal and watch the note,
To see if the application works, I mapped port 8080 to 3000 in Docker so that what will be displayed on the host in 8080 reflects 3000 in Docker.
