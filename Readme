# Web Server Application - Print "Im Ofir.."

This simple web server application prints the message "Im Ofir..." when accessed. It is built using Node.js.

## Running the Application Locally

notice that before running the docker you have download the following programs:
NodeJs, docker and login to your docker user.

Building a Docker image involves creating a Dockerfile that defines the image's contents and 
configuration and then using the docker build command to build the image
 
 to create dockerfile:
 -# Use an official Node.js runtime as a base image
 -# Set the working directory in the container
 -# Install application dependencies
 -# Copy the application code to the container
 -# Define the command to run your application
 
 After building the Dockerfile, build the Docker image with the build command.
 After that, you can use the run command
 
since i already uploded the docker image to the dockerhub,we can just run the 2 following command:
sudo docker pull ofirdabah/devops_intern
sudo docker run -it -p 8080:3000 --name node-app ofirdabah/devops_intern


difficulties: 

Run docker in Windows so that it works in Linux - I understood that some software was required, so I decided to use a virtual machine (which caused a delay because I had to download and install the operating system)

Another difficulty was routing a port from the host to Docker, I used a YouTube guide that helped me find the solution by running a command that would do the routing
